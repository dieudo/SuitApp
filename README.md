# SuitApp
I worked in retail for over 15 years in fine-clothing for men. 
I had been involved in every side of the business: sales, management, clientele building, products development(design, style, and fashion), planning, and forecasting, growth strategies. 
I consider myself an expert on this field, and I am hoping that this app could reflect that as well; 
It could be used to find your size and fit on a garment and recommend hand-picked sites that reflect my expertise in this industry; 
regularly new features will be added.
